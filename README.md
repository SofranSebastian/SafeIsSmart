safeissmart is a cross-platform mobile application developed with the React-Native framework under the Expo managed workflow which aims 
to create a smart mobility environment for all it's users by offering quick finding of all institutions that can provide medical support 
in the area chosen by the user plus a navigation to the chosen place.

The core functionality is represented by the navigation which has a smart alert system for warning the driver/pedestrian when he/she is 
about to encounter a dangerous intersection or crosswalk on the way to the medical institution.
